/*
 * (Game: bean machine) The bean machine, also known as a quincunx or the 
 * Galton box, is a device for statistics experiments named after English scientist Sir
 * Francis Galton. It consists of an upright board with evenly spaced nails (or pegs)
 * in a triangular form. 
 *
 * Balls are dropped from the opening of the board. Every time a ball hits a nail, it
 * has a 50% chance of falling to the left or to the right. The piles of balls are 
 * accumulated in the slots at the bottom of the board. 
 *
 * Write a program that stimulates the bean machine. Your program should prompt the
 * user to enter the number of balls and the number of the slots in the machine.
 * Stimulate the falling of each balls by printing its path. For example, the path for 
 * the ball in Figure 7.13b is LLRRLLR and the path for the ball in Figure 7.13C is
 * RLRRLRR. Display the final buildup of the balls in the slots in a histogram. 
 *
 * (Hint: Create an array names slots. Each element in slots stores the number of 
 * balls in a slot. Each  ball falls into a slot via a path. The number of Rs in a path is the 
 * position of the slot where the ball falls. For example, for the path LRLRLRR, the ball 
 * falls into slots[4], and for the path RRLLLLL, the ball falls into slots[2].)
